PAST TENSE
Definition :- Past tense is a grammatical tense that indicates actions, events, or states that have occurred or were completed in the past. 
		In English, verbs typically change form to indicate past tense, often by adding "-ed" to the base form of regular verbs (e.g., "walked," "talked," "played"). 
		
		The past tense is used to narrate or describe actions, events, or states that took place before the present moment or within a specific time frame in the past.
Example's :-Past tense: "She sang beautifully."
		
		Past tense: "He ate dinner at 7 PM."
